# 1. Description

Code source of the paper ```Evaluating Tokenizaer Impact on OOVs Representation with Transformers Models``` to be presented at LREC 2022.

## Abstract

Transformer models have achieved significant improvements in multiple downstream tasks in recent years. One of the main contributions of Transformers is their ability to create new representations for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. In this paper, we have evaluated three categories of OOVs: (A) new domain-specific terms (e.g., "eucaryote" in microbiology), (B) misspelled words containing typos, and (C) cross-domain homographs (e.g., "arm" has different meanings in a clinical trial and in anatomy). We use three French domain-specific datasets on the legal, medical, and energetical domains to robustly analyze these categories. Our experiments have led to exciting findings that showed: (1) It is easier to improve the representation of new words (A and B) than it is for words that already exist in the vocabulary of the Transformer models (C), (2) To ameliorate the representation of OOVs, the most effective method relies on adding external morpho-syntactic context rather than improving the semantic understanding of the words directly (fine-tuning) and (3) We cannot foresee the impact of minor misspellings in words because similar misspellings have different impacts on their representation. We believe that tackling the challenges of processing OOVs regarding their specificities will significantly help the domain adaptation aspect of BERT.

# 2. Installation

Install the package with pip:
```bash
pip install .
```

Install the package with conda:
```bash
conda install -f environment.yml
```

Make sure all the dependencies have been installed using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 3. How to ?

## Gallica Extractor

To extract journals from gallica, use the script ``src/data/gallica.py``. In the original paper, we used "Journal of Microbiology" that you can change in the script (line 45):
```python
PRESSE_MEDICALE = [("journal_microbiologie", "http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb34348753q/date", 1887, 1900)]
```
You can add other newspapers using the format ("name of the paper", "gallica link", "start date", "end date").
